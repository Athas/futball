FUTBALL
=======

Your universe is an infinite tile floor inhabited by rolling marbles.
There is no way out.  Your only hope is to survive as long as
possible, although it is ultimately hopeless.

Futball is written in Python, with graphics generated by a ray tracer
written in [Futhark](https://futhark-lang.org).  No polygons anywhere!

Usage
-----

Run `make` to compile.  You will need:

  * [Futhark](https://futhark-lang.org), probably at least version 0.6
  * pygame
  * Numpy
  * pyopencl

The latter three can be installed with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

Controls
--------

Move around with WASD, look with the mouse, and jump with the space
bar.

Windows?
--------

Probably not.
