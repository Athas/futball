FUTBALL
=======

Your universe is an infinite tile floor inhabited by rolling marbles.
There is no way out.  Your only hope is to survive as long as
possible, although it is ultimately hopeless.

Futball is written in Python, with graphics generated by a ray tracer
written in [Futhark](https://futhark-lang.org).  No polygons anywhere!

Usage
-----

Run `make` to compile.  You will need:

  * [Futhark](https://futhark-lang.org), probably at least version 0.6 ([installation instructions](https://futhark.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html))
  * pygame
  * Numpy
  * pyopencl

The latter three can be installed with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

If you are very brave, you can also try
[futhark-pycffi](https://github.com/pepijndevos/futhark-pycffi).
Install it and run `make _engine.so`.  The game will automatically
pick it up.

Controls
--------

Move around with WASD or the arrow keys, look with the mouse, and jump
with the space bar.

Windows?
--------

Probably not.
